## Selection Sort

Find the smallest unsorted element and add it to the end of the sorted list.

**In pseudocode**:
- Repeat until no unsorted elements remain:
-- Search the unsorted part of the data to find the smallest value
-- Swap the smallest found value with the first element of the unsorted part
